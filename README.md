# QaFinalProject
### Brief
This is the FinalProject for QA.  
This is a JAVA Web application that I created on the QA Software Development Bootcamp.

#### Requirements
> -	Code fully integrated into a Version Control System 
> -	A relational database, locally or within the Cloud, which is used to persist data for the project.
> -	A functional application ‘back-end’, written in a suitable framework of the language covered in training (Java/Spring Boot)
> -	A build (.jar) of your application, including any dependencies it might need, produced using an integrated build tool (Maven).
> -	A series of API calls designed with postman, used for CRUD functionality. (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
To create  
a working Spring Boot API making use of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that were
covered during our training. 


## Details of my project
The implementation is fairly simple, to keep the project scope in check (To build a project to demonstrate our Software knowledge and skills). 
The project is a web application (computer store).We wanted to creat a working Spring Boot API making use of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that were
covered during our training and to expand the knowledge of JAVA and of functions like connecting the app to a database. 
 
### Technologies
* We used Git as a version control system with GitHub as the provider to store, maintain and amend our code. 

* Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (MySQL)

* Programming Language (Java)

* Programming Language for UI (CSS,JS)

* API Development (Spring Boot)

* We used Maven for a uniform build system

* Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

* API Calls using Postman


 
  
## Methods available in API

Create an account user by introducing the following fields:
* Username
* Password
* First Name
* Last Name 
* Email


If any of the fields are empty an error message is beeing generated and return the registration page back to the user.

Log in using :
* Username
* Password


If the any of the fields are empty or are not coresponding with the data in the database an error message is beeing generated and returns the login page back to the user.

* Update any user 

The user can update any user , including the one is used for log in using the same registration form previously used.

* Delete any user

The user can delete any record from database.

* Search

The user can search for a user or a product in the database using the search form on the top of the table.



### Future Improvements
I will work to successfully implement multiple user permisions as (admin,registered user, guest user) methodologies and technologies to let user buy and pay for products.
Add the function to manage products stock and add images of the products.
